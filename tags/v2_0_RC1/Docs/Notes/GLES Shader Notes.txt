Notes to remember when building GLES Shaders...
---------------------------------------------------

Precision:
	Set a precision for all floating point types..
	
	highp	= 32-bit	Use for positions, matrices, lighting calculations, skinning calcs, etc)
	mediump	= 16-bit	Use for varying texture coordinates.
	lowp	= 10-bit	Use for colors or data from low-precision textures (Normal maps, etc)
	
Coordinate Spaces:
	Q: What coordinate space should we do lighting / transforms / etc in?
	A: Whichever space requires the least amount of calculations  
		IE: pre transform a light to model space, then do lighting, then transform from model straight to projected space.
			VS xForm everything to world, then do calcs, then xform to projected..
	
	
Static VS Dynamic branching
	Static	= Branching based on parameters from uniforms.	IE: if(Numlights == 0)
	Dynamic	= Branching based on calculated values.			IE: if(position.X > 0)
