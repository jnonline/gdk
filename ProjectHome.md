The GDK is a Software Development Kit for building cross-platform C++ mobile (and desktop) games.

Half of the GDK is a full C++ application shell for building a game that runs on PC, MAC, & iOS  (Android coming soon).   With direct support for OpenGL 2.1 & OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.  And robust libraries for Math, Assets, Rendering, etc

The other Half is a full suite of content tools for compiling various game assets (Textures, sprites, animations, models, shaders, fonts, etc) into each platform's native format.  (Which the C++ side seamlessly loads & uses)
