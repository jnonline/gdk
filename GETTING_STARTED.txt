This document explains the steps for starting up a new GDK project.
By the end, you should have a running game on any of the supported GDK platforms :)

====================================================
==    Starting a new GDK based Project
====================================================

Create the project  
----------------------------------

==== On WINDOWS ====

1)  From a cmd shell, Run the "CreateNewProject-WIN" script in the root of this bundle.
     - Param 1:   Path to your new project..  can be absolute or relative (IE: ../MonkeyFight)
     - Param 2:   Name of your Game Project.  Must be alphanumeric and not contain any spaces. like a standard C++ identifier  (IE: MonkeyFight)

    Example:   CreateNewProject-WIN  "C:\MonkeyFight"  MonkeyFight	


=== On MAC ===

1)  From a bash/terminal shell.  Run the "CreateNewProject-MAC" script in the root of this bundle.
     - Param 1:   Path to your new project..  can be absolute or relative (IE: ../MonkeyFight)
     - Param 2:   Name of your Game Project.  Must be alphanumeric and not contain any spaces. like a standard C++ identifier  (IE: MonkeyFight)
	
    Example:   CreateNewProject-MAC  "../MonkeyFight"  MonkeyFight	


Building & Running
--------------------------------------

1)  You new project folder will have the following directory structure:

    \YourProject
      \Assets		- All assets for your game project
      \Build		- Build projects for every supported platform
      \Source		- Source code for the Gdk library & your starter game
      \Tools		- Various tools used for building GDK assets

2)  Open the project file for your favorite platform in the \Build folder

3)  Compile & Run your starter game :D


Start Coding
-----------------------

1)  Open up the Source\Game\YourGame.cpp file

2)  This file/class contains the main entry points for your game's execution.  
    It contains the following methods:

        OnLoadSettings()	: This method is called once, prior to the initialization stage of your game. 
                                  Here you can specify custom app settings such as your window title, window size, etche

        OnInit()		: This method is called when your game is first initialized.  At this point you are free to begin
                                  loading assets into your game such as images, models, sounds, etc.

        OnShutdown()		: This method tells your game it is being shut down.  (Either by the user or by the operating system)

        OnUpdate()		: Once per game tick, this update method is called to allow you to update any game state.  

        OnDraw()		: Once per game tick (after the OnUpdate), the OnDraw method is called.  
                                  This is where you can do any game specific rendering or drawing.

Where do I go from here??
--------------------------

    Take a look at the various samples & tests in the Gdk/Samples folder.  There are example for 2D/3D rendering, various input mechanisms, etc.

    Peruse the documentation & explanation videos on the GDK website.
